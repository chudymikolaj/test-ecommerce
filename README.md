# test-ecommerce

If you wanted to run this site in production, you should install modules then build the site with `npm run build` and run it with `npm start`:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

You should run `npm run build` again any time you make changes to the site.

>Note: If you are already running a webserver on port 80 (e.g. Macs usually have the Apache webserver running on port 80) you can still start the example in production mode by passing a different port as an Environment Variable when starting (e.g. PORT=3000 npm start).
